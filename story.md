Chapter 1: Obsession
Susan Orlean: John Laroche, to begin with, was this truly odd specimen. He was a serial monogamist. He became fixated on something, whatever it was, fossils, old mirrors, orchids, just devouring it, devoting himself to it, being completely focused on it. Had this desire to own every possible example of this thing. And then walking away from it. That was the part of it that I found baffling. I thought of myself as somebody who was completely the opposite, I thought I will never give up something that I loved as much as he loves these things. I would never just abandon an obsession.

Host June Cohen: That’s journalist Susan Orlean, and she’s about to tell us the story of writing The Orchid Thief — which began as an article in the New Yorker, and evolved into a best-selling non-fiction book. Which was then adapted into a movie, called … Adaptation.

The Orchid Thief was a true story of a man, John Laroche, and his quest to find rare orchids — especially the ghost orchid. But it’s a book that defies categorization. It’s about swamps and the Seminole (Indian) tribe; panthers and plant collectors. And most of all, it’s a book about obsession. 

I’m June Cohen, cofounder of WaitWhat, former Executive Producer of TED and your host for Spark & Fire. But this isn’t an interview show. It’s a story, told entirely in Susan’s own words.

Chapter 3: The wobbly moment

How do you move past a creative crisis? Apply pressure.

Susan Orlean: The minute the plane landed, I could barely stand waiting for the flight to end, I busted into the office at the New Yorker. I had torn that story out of the newspaper, so I had this frayed little piece of newsprint in my hand. I went in to my editor, Tina Brown, and I said, “You’ve got to look at this, and I’ve got to do this story.” She had no interest either in orchids or toothless men with pillowcases of flowers. This was not her sort of subject. 

I mean, she was asking the legitimate question, which is, “Why is this an interesting story? I’ll trust you, but you have to convince me.”

I think she responded to my intense curiosity, just: “This is so weird. I need to know the answer to why this happened.”

To her credit, even though I didn’t know what it was that I was pursuing, she said, “Go ahead.” I left for Florida a few days later. I probably got back on the same plane that I had just flown back to New York on. 

This is always the wobbly moment for me. I begin first with this enormous amount of confidence, this feeling that this is the most interesting story ever in the history of the world. Moments later, jumping on the plane, settling in, I have the second wave of emotion, which is terror.

That terror really is a two-headed monster. It’s both my doubts about the story and my doubt about whether I can tell it. I always try to remind myself that I go through this every time I write anything, and that it’s a natural part of the process. 

Creativity is dependent in huge proportion on confidence. 

There are times when you need the external push. The fact is the New Yorker bought me a plane ticket, and paid for my hotel room. I arrived in Florida, and unpacked my bags, and sat in my hotel room, thinking: “I said I was going to do it, so I better do it.”
