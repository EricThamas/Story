Chapter 1: Obsession
Susan Orlean: John Laroche, to begin with, was this truly odd specimen. He was a serial monogamist. He became fixated on something, whatever it was, fossils, old mirrors, orchids, just devouring it, devoting himself to it, being completely focused on it. Had this desire to own every possible example of this thing. And then walking away from it. That was the part of it that I found baffling. I thought of myself as somebody who was completely the opposite, I thought I will never give up something that I loved as much as he loves these things. I would never just abandon an obsession.

Host June Cohen: That’s journalist Susan Orlean, and she’s about to tell us the story of writing The Orchid Thief — which began as an article in the New Yorker, and evolved into a best-selling non-fiction book. Which was then adapted into a movie, called … Adaptation.

The Orchid Thief was a true story of a man, John Laroche, and his quest to find rare orchids — especially the ghost orchid. But it’s a book that defies categorization. It’s about swamps and the Seminole (Indian) tribe; panthers and plant collectors. And most of all, it’s a book about obsession. 

I’m June Cohen, cofounder of WaitWhat, former Executive Producer of TED and your host for Spark & Fire. But this isn’t an interview show. It’s a story, told entirely in Susan’s own words.
