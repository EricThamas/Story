Chapter 2: The spark 
Where do you find a new idea? The place you didn’t expect.
Susan Orlean: So I was rifling around in the seat pocket on a plane, something I don’t necessarily recommend that anybody ever do, because you never know what you’re going to find. And someone had left a copy of the Miami Herald. I thought, “All right, I’m going to read the Miami Herald.” My eye fell on a headline that said “Local nurserymen and group of Seminoles arrested with rare orchids.” I mean: Who isn’t going to read that story? 

It described an arrest in the Fakahatchee Strand, a place I’d never heard of, which was a state preserve, of this local man, John Laroche, who had a crew of three men with him, who happened to be members of the Seminole Tribe, and they were arrested with six pillowcases full of rare orchids. My brain was on fire. I didn’t know anything about orchids. I didn’t know orchids grew wild in Florida. I had no idea why anyone would steal orchids. My thought is, if you wanted an orchid, you went to Home Depot and bought them.

Many stories have a singular question. This had so many questions. What was the Fakahatchee Strand? Why would you collect orchids? Why did he have, in particular, a crew of Seminole men with him? 

It’s the feeling that a door just opened onto a world that I didn’t even know existed and I thought, “I need to know more.” 


In 1994, the story of orchid thefts in the Fakahatchee Strand played out across the pages of the Miami Herald, in stories by journalist Lori Rozsa and others that track the thefs and the subsequent court case. Susan’s original newspaper clipping is long gone, she told us.
